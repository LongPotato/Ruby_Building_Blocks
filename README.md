### Caesar_Cipher 
An encription method, which take 2 arguments, a string, and a shift key number. The program will replace the letter from the orignal string with the letter from some fixed position in the alphabet that was shifted to by the shift key.

### Stock_Picker 
The method takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It should return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell.

### SubString 
The method takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings as the second argument. It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.

### Bubble_Sort
A sorting algorithm, where each element is compared to the one next to it and they are swapped if the one on the right is larger than the one on the left. This continues until the array is eventually sorted.

### Enumerable 
Rebuild the famous Enumerable module of Ruby.
